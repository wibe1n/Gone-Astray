&tutorial_combatTutorial_part0_This is the tutorial for fighting monsters in Sestra. The fight is a game of light and darkness.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part1
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part1_On the right you see sphere of light and a sphere of dark.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part2
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part2_Your goal is to try to have stronger aura of light than the enemys aura of darkness

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part3
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part3_Right now your sphere of light is smaller than the sphere of dark, click on the lightball to add more light.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part4
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part4_Great! When you add more light you use one of your collected fireflies. The strenght of one firefly varies, so the light added varies too

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part5
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part5_However, be careful when adding more light! If the light amount exceeds the circle around it you lose!
