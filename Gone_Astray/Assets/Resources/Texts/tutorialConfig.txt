&tutorial_combatTutorial_part0_This is the tutorial for fighting monsters in Sestra. Click on the little arrow to continue.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part1
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part1_The fight is a game of light and darkness. On the right you see two spheres, that represent them.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part2
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part2_Your goal is to try to have as strong aura of light as the enemys aura of darkness.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part3
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part3_You start the fight with no light at all so try and click on the lightball to add more light.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part4
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part4_Great! When you add more light you encourage Fia to go a little closer.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part5
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part5_The courage of Fia varies, so the light added is a little random too.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part6
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part6_However, be careful when adding more light! If the light amount exceeds the monster treshold, monster will get agitated!

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part7
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part7_Now it looks like your light is still little smaller than the enemys darkness, try adding some light once more.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part8
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part8_It looks like you managed to match the spheres pretty close. Since you have now good chance of winning, press proceed to pass your turn

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part9
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part9_Oh no! Looks like the lights weren't close enough... but don't worry

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part10
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part10_You can try to beat the monster 3 times before it gets too dangerous.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part11
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part11_Let's try using one of your fireflies to make this easier. On the left bottom you see Use firefly button.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part12
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part12_Using a firefly makes the monster treshold little wider so you have more chance of succeeding.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part13
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part13_Click on the use firefly button to use one of your fireflies.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part14
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part14_Great! Now click on the lightball once again and try to match the lightball and darkness.

%tutorial_combatTutorial _0_part15
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part15_A little more...

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part16
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part16_Alright, let's see if we can win this time!

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part17
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part17_Nice! You managed to defeat the darkness!

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part18
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part18_Since you won, you get all your used fireflies back!

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part19
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part19_But be careful using our fireflies, should you lose the fireflies will run away...
