&tutorial_combatTutorial_part0_This is the tutorial for fighting monsters in Sestra. Click on the little arrow to continue.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part1
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part1_The fight is a game of light and darkness. On the right you see two spheres, that represent them.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part2
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part2_Your goal is to try to have stronger aura of light than the enemys aura of darkness.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part3
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part3_Right now your sphere of light is smaller than the sphere of dark, click on the lightball to add more light.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part4
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part4_Great! When you add more light you encourage Fia to go a little closer.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part5
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part5_The courage of Fia varies, so the light added is a little random too.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part6
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part6_However, be careful when adding more light! If the light amount exceeds the monster treshold, monster will get agitated!

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part7
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part7_Now your light is pretty close the monsters darkness so you have a good chance of winning!

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part8
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part8_Press proceed to pass your turn

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part9
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part9_Nice! As you saw, the enemy is now also trying to grow its sphere of dark. It will continue to do so, as long as it is losing.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part10
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part10_The enemy is still behind so it has no other choice than to try add more darkness.

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part11
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part11_Oh my, the darkness exceeded to circle!

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part12
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part12_Gongratulations! You managed to conquer your fears and defeated the darkness!

%tutorial_combatTutorial_0_part13
&tutorial_combatTutorial_part13_You have gained all the fireflies you used back! In case you would have lost, the fireflies would run away...so be careful.
