&npc_npc1_part4_What are you doing here after dark?

%npc_npc1_0_part5
&npc_npc1_part5_You're looking for your sister? Hey, we could ask my Kin!

%npc_npc1_0_part6
&npc_npc1_part6_If your sister's passed here, someone must've seen her.

%npc_npc1_0_part7
&npc_npc1_part7_The problem is I'm locked out here and no one will answer the door...

&npc_npc1_part10_Lucky for you, you just happened to wander onto our front porch.

%npc_npc1_0_part11
&npc_npc1_part11_Isn't it pretty? This is the home of the fireflies!

%npc_npc1_0_part12
&npc_npc1_part12_Now let's see about that key...

%npc_npc1_0_part13
&npc_npc1_part13_It's a magical plant called Raskovnik. I think It's around here somewhere...

%npc_npc1_0_part14
&npc_npc1_part14_Here it is! Look here, this is a Raskovnik. They're magic and can open doors.

%npc_npc1_0_part15
&npc_npc1_part15_This one opens our front door! Go ahead and pick it up.

%npc_npc2_1_part1
&npc_npc2_part1_Fia: I seem to have, ummm... lost the key...

%npc_npc2_1_part2
&npc_npc2_part2_Fia: Could you help me look for it? It's a magical plant called Raskovnik.

%npc_npc2_1_part3
&npc_npc2_part3_Fia: It has to be somewhere in this forest. Let's just hope some creature hasn't took it.
