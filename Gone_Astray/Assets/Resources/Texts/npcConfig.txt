&npc_npc1_part6_What are you doing out here in the forest all by yourself? It gets very dangerous after dark.

%npc_npc1_0_part7
&npc_npc1_part7_You're looking for your sister? That's funny, I'm also looking for my family.

%npc_npc1_0_part8
&npc_npc1_part8_You know, it's not safe out here in the dark, especially not all alone.

&npc_npc1_part11_You'll help me out? That's great! Okay, first, let's walk out from this cave.

%npc_npc1_0_part12
&npc_npc1_part12_See that big tree over ahead? Isn't it pretty? That is where we fireflies call home.

%npc_npc1_0_part13
&npc_npc1_part13_But something has scared my family away. Could you help me find them?

%npc_npc2_1_part1
&npc_npc2_part1_Fia: I seem to have, ummm... lost the key...

%npc_npc2_1_part2
&npc_npc2_part2_Fia: Could you help me look for it? It's a magical plant called Raskovnik.

%npc_npc2_1_part3
&npc_npc2_part3_Fia: It has to be somewhere in this forest. Let's just hope some creature hasn't took it.
